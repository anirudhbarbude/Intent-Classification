Intent classification (sometimes called intent recognition) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP). Intent classification analyzes the intentions behind texts and categorizes them such as requests or approvals.
Intent classification takes the written or spoken texts as input and uses ML and NLP techniques to assign every single word to their intent automatically.
The input can be in the form of text or speech. Speech input must be converted to text form with speech-to-text technology.
Intents that are appropriate for the use case should be determined.
Then, intent classifiers are trained and text is labeled with intents. For example, the sentence “I want to chat with David” indicates a request and can be tagged as such.
